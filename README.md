# Pinecil_LED_Ring
LED ring attachment for the Pinecil V2 soldering iron (should work for V1 as well as it goes on the body)

The board is all done in KiCad and the zip file is all you need to produce a board. 
The LED is a 3mm LED
The SMD resistor is an 0603 with hand soldering footprint

Calculate your resistor based on the LED you choose and the power source form the Pinecil you decide to use as well.

Recommend a header for the power and ground or you can solder sold strand wire preferrably to the holes and to the iron.


The info on size of board according to Oshpark is: 2 layer board of 0.84 x 0.67 inches (21.2 x 17.1 mm)
